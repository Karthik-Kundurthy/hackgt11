Harish Kanthi: How do I solve this one 
Karthik Kundurthy: Resistance = resistivity * Length/Area 
Karthik Kundurthy: EMF = dflux/dt = Area of 1 wire in loop * dB/dt 
Karthik Kundurthy: Calculate Emf/resistance and multiple by 4 
Karthik Kundurthy: Did you do fall 2021 practice test? 
Harish Kanthi: Ok thanks 
Harish Kanthi: Nah not yet
